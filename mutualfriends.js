### `mutualFollowers.push(bobsFollowers[i])` Explained:

In your code, the goal is to find **mutual followers** between `bobsFollowers` and `tinasFollowers`. Once a match is found, we add (or **push**) the mutual follower to the `mutualFollowers` array.

### Key Points:

- **`bobsFollowers[i] === tinasFollowers[j]`** is a **comparison** that checks if a follower from `bobsFollowers` is also in `tinasFollowers`. 
- When **true**, it means you have a **mutual follower**.
- **`mutualFollowers.push(bobsFollowers[i])`** is **adding** that mutual follower to the `mutualFollowers` array.

### Why **`.push()`** Works Here:
- **`push()`** is used to **add an item** to the end of an array. So when you find a match (`bobsFollowers[i] === tinasFollowers[j]`), you want to **add the value** (`bobsFollowers[i]`) to the `mutualFollowers` array.
- **`bobsFollowers[i]`** is the actual value you're comparing, and you want to add it to the `mutualFollowers` array if it's a match.

### **Incorrect Version:**

If you were to write something like:

```javascript
mutualFollowers.push(bobsFollowers[i] === tinasFollowers[j]);
```

This would not work the way you want. Here's why:

- `bobsFollowers[i] === tinasFollowers[j]` is a **boolean** expression (either `true` or `false`).
- So, **`push()`** would be adding either `true` or `false` to the `mutualFollowers` array, not the actual name of the follower.

### **Correct Version:**

```javascript
mutualFollowers.push(bobsFollowers[i]);
```

This correctly adds the actual follower name (e.g., `'Bibek'`) to the `mutualFollowers` array.

### Full Explanation of Your Code:

```javascript
let bobsFollowers = ['Bibek', 'Nini', 'Milan', 'Manoz'];
let tinasFollowers = ['Bibek', 'Nini', 'Sudip'];
let mutualFollowers = [];

for (let i = 0; i < bobsFollowers.length; i++) {            // Loop through bobsFollowers
  for (let j = 0; j < tinasFollowers.length; j++) {          // Loop through tinasFollowers
    if (bobsFollowers[i] === tinasFollowers[j]) {            // Check if the followers match
      mutualFollowers.push(bobsFollowers[i]);                 // If they match, add to mutualFollowers
    }
  }
}

console.log(mutualFollowers);                                  // Output the mutual followers
```

### What Happens:
1. The outer loop goes through `bobsFollowers` one by one.
2. The inner loop checks each follower from `tinasFollowers` to see if it matches the current `bobsFollowers[i]`.
3. If a match is found, **`bobsFollowers[i]`** (the name of the mutual follower) is added to the `mutualFollowers` array using **`.push()`**.
4. Finally, the `mutualFollowers` array is printed, showing the mutual followers between Bob and Tina.

### Final Output:
```javascript
['Bibek', 'Nini']
```

---

### Summary:
- **`.push()`** adds values (like strings or numbers) to an array.
- **`bobsFollowers[i] === tinasFollowers[j]`** is the comparison, and if it's `true`, the matching follower name is added to `mutualFollowers`.
- Using `mutualFollowers.push(bobsFollowers[i] === tinasFollowers[j])` would add `true` or `false` instead of the actual name.

Does that clear up the confusion? ðŸ˜Š*/
